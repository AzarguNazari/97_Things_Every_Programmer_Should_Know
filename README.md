# 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know

## 1: Act with Prudence
- In time of underpressure and tight scheduling, if you have to choose between "doing it right" and "doing it quick", chooce "do it quick" with understanding that you will come back and fix it later. Techn ical debt is like a loan, the sooner you pay, the less interest it will cost.

# 2: Appply Functional Programming Principles
- "Mastery of the fucntional programming paradigm can greatly improve the quality of the code. If you deeply understand and appy the functional paradigm, your designs will exhibit a much higher degree of referential transparency."

# 3: Ask, "What Would the User Do? (You are Not the User)
- "The best way to find out how a user thinks is to watch one"
- What paragrammers think is different from what users do and experiment. So, better to learn from the user.

# 4: Automate Your Code Standard
- Automate build process, code format, and code analysis
- "Make source code formatting is part of the build process, so that everybody runs it automatically every time they compile the code.
- "Use static code analysis tools to scan the code for unwanted antipatterns. If any are found, break the build.
- "Learn to configure those tools so that you can scan for your own, project-specifiction antipatterns"

# 5: Beauty Is in Simplicity
- "Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depends on simplicity" - Plato
- "There are a number of things we strive for in our code: Readibility, Maintainability, Speed of development, and The elusive quality of beauty"
- "Each individual part is kept simple with simple responsibilities and simple relationships with the other parts of the system. This is the way we can keep our systems maintainable over time with clean, simple, testable code, ensuring a high speed of development throughout the lifetime of the system". Beauty is born of and found in simplicity

# 6: Before You Refactor
 - Before refactoring existing code, make tests to ensure the stability of code
 - "Avoid the temptation to rewrite everything"
 - "Many incremental changes are better than one massive change"
 - "After each development iteration, it is important to ensure that the existing tests pass"
 - "Personal preferences and ego shouln't get in the way"
 - "New technology is an insufficient reason to refactor"
 - "Remember that humans make mistakes and restructuring will not always guarantee that the new code will be better, or even as good as the previous attempt"
